Efficient Compression Tool
============================

Efficient Compression Tool (or ECT) is a C++ file optimizer.  
It supports PNG, JPEG, GZIP and ZIP files.

Performance (v0.9.2)
-------------------------
All tests were run on macOS 12.5 using an Intel i7-7700HQ and clang.  
File: enwik8, 100,000,000 bytes, compressed into gzip format

## Building
To build ECT, you need to recursively clone it, just downloading isnâ€™t enough, i. e. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool.git`  
You may also need to install `nasm` if it is not available already.

### Command line
ECT is built with `cmake`  
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make
```

In addition, you can add the following arguments to the cmake call to turn various features on and off:  
- `-DECT_MULTITHREADING=OFF`: Turn off multithreading support

### With Xcode
You can use cmake to generate an Xcode project.  Just add `-G Xcode` to the end of the cmake command:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src -G Xcode
make
```
You will run into a slight issue in that Xcode doesn't know how to compile some of the asm files within mozjpeg.  To fix this, locate your copy of `nasm` (`/usr/local/bin/nasm` in the example) navigate to the Build Rules of the `simd` target, and add a custom rule to process source files matching `*.asm` with the following script:
```sh
/usr/local/bin/nasm "-I${PROJECT_DIR}/mozjpeg" -DMACHO -D__x86_64__ "-I${PROJECT_DIR}/mozjpeg/simd/nasm/" "-I${PROJECT_DIR}/mozjpeg/simd/x86_64/" -f macho64 -o "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/x86_64/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.o" "${INPUT_FILE_PATH}"
```
and set `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/x86_64/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.o` as the output files.

If you are using Xcode for development and do not need maximum speed, you can also disable the asm files by adding `-DWITH_SIMD=OFF` to the cmake.
