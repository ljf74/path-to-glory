To build ECT, you need to recursively clone it, just downloading isnâ€™t enough, i. e. git clone --recursive https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool.git

CMake Build:
ECT is built with cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make

Makefile Build (deprecated and unsupported):
Use the Makefile to build dependencies and the binary:
cd src/
make

Dependencies:
CMake
Make
NASM

Tested Operating Systems and Compilers:
Debian Wheezy (GCC)
Mac OS X 10.10 (GCC and LLVM/Clang)
Windows 8 (MinGW)
For using other compilers than GCC, you may need to change the Makefile.
